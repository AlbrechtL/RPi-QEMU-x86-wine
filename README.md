RPi-QEMU-x86-wine SD-card image
===============================


Description
-----------
This Raspberry Pi image enables you to run x86 Linux and Windows applications on a Raspberry Pi (all models inc pi3).
The build is based on the information found in the following thread: https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=17701&start=25#p84325

(Originally based on AlbrechtL's Wheezy image - updated to work with Pi Zero, and Pi3 )

Download
--------
Latest Stretch version:

- [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DH4DsFXS6ZRtUksqWzD94eRH4KB3VTB2]

- [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pi-qemu-wine/]

Installation
------------
- You will need an 8 GB SD-card
- Unpack the image
- Copy the image to a SD-card

        # sudo dd bs=4M if=20150924_RPi-QEMU-x86-wine.img /dev/mmcblk

- Put the SD-card into your Raspberry Pi

Usage
-----
Two user are available
- Username: pi
- Password: raspberry


- Username: root
- Password: 123456

To run x86 Linux and Windows programs just run the "start_x86env_wine-user" script as the "pi" user in a terminal.
     
    # sudo /home/pi/start_x86env_wine-user

Now you are in a Debian wheezy i386 enviroment and you can try to load any x86 program. Inside the chroot enviroment you are logged in as the user "wine-user".

To run Windows programs just run "wine". Notepad example:

    # wine ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/notepad.exe


If you would like to use programs that need super user access like "apt-get" run the script "/home/pi/start_x86env_root" instead of "start_x86env_wine-user":

    # sudo /home/pi/start_x86env_root

Speed
-----
Don't expect a super fast PC! The x86 emulation is done by QEMU in software.
Some people said it is as fast as a 300 MHz Pentium PC. But benchmarks a welcome!
